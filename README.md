# Hotel-reservation-system
The project presents a hotel reservation system using three types of UML diagrams. The use case diagram includes actors, hotel reservation system use cases, and an external system. In order to make the diagram clear, an abstract actor was created, which is the system user.Three sequence diagrams were created to present the operating scenarios of the reservation system: room reservation, cancellation of reservation, price change in the system.The last diagram - the activity diagram, shows the flow of the hotel room booking process. The flow starts with searching for a room and ends with sending the booking confirmation.
